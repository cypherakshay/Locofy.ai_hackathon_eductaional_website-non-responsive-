# `FINDCODER HACKATHON` - Generate code with A.I. powered Plugin Locofy.ai in few minutes

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




## **CYPHER EDUCATION** -*Education website generated with figma plugin - Locofy.ai*   `(static page website demo)`

&nbsp;

> ## **Project Description**

&nbsp;

In this hackathon, Locofy gives a problem statement to freely use its Locofy plugin with Figma and create a good visual web/app by generating front-end code with A.I. <br>

So, I created an educational website with Figma and then used the Locofy plugin to tag some elements (you can check the explanation video below). And the whole frontend code is generated in a few minutes. then I push this to the GitHub repo and deploy it on Netlify.


**Now, there is a new slang on the internet :**
&nbsp;

>***" FIGMA to LOCOFY "***

&nbsp;

### Disclaimer :
`Please consider a laptop screen of 1440px to check this website. This is not mobile responsive and the best visual will fit on the laptop screen. 
Locofy is new to me so, I was a little confused about how to configure responsiveness and many options like hover effects and so on. but I will consider it my prior wishlist to learn this technology precisely.   `
